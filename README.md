# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Description
 
The bootcamp challenge for this week was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Installation

## Usage

To use code, you can review the javascript file above. To view the result of the code, you need to view them directly on the live web page by opening the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see the result of the code.

You can find the link to the deployed live webpage here:
